# ReSwift-Enigma
A highly tested example of using the ReSwift framework to create a unidirectional data flow with Redux in an iOS Swift application.

## ReSwift
I became interested in [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) after working with Redux in React-Native. ReSwift is an easy to read and lightweight way of implementing a unidirectional data flow in native Swift apps.

## Tests
Whilst not strictly TDD due to the tests being written after the code, this project contains a large number of tests which thoroughly check it's working. The code was also deliberately written in a seperated and testable style.
